# Hi 

I am Benjamin and working on various projects in the PHP community:

- Maintaining [Doctrine ORM](https://github.com/doctrine/orm/) and other Doctrine projects
- Contributing to PHP Core, for example [Attributes](https://www.php.net/manual/de/language.attributes.php) and [DOM Improvements](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dom_living_standard_api).
- [Gyro](https://github.com/gyro-project/mvc-bundle), an opinionated framework on top of Symfony framework

If you want to support my work I would be happy if you look into my companies
product [Tideways](https://tideways.com). [Tideways](https://tideways.com) is a
PHP Profiler, Monitoring and Exception Tracking tool in one.

If you want to follow my work [check out my blog](https://beberlei.de) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/beberlei)
